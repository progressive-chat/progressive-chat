# What skiff says about a node

Notes kept as they were learned, each with what it costs when it is not
known. Nothing here is guessed: every line was read out of the library's
source, or off the painted page through a probe. They were read against
`pinned-cmake` v0.2.53 of skiff and its widgets, which is what this program
asks for; where the library moves on, none of this has been said again.

## A node with no size of its own is nothing at all

A `scene::Node` holding children, asked for neither a width nor a height nor
`fill`, is a box of zero in both: a size is read out of what a node holds,
and nothing here holds anything of a size's own.

What it costs: a child anchored `kTopRight` is put at the corner of nothing,
which is the parent's own corner -- and the top bar's presses all landed on
the same point at the room's right edge, whichever of them was pressed.

What is said instead: `this->apply({.fill = true});`, which is what every
node made only to hold others says in its constructor here.

## A field says its own height, and what is said to it is not heard

`widgets::TextArea::measure()` writes `fState.fHeight` from the lines it is
holding and nothing else -- so a `.height` in its spec is read nowhere, and
the field is one line tall when there is nothing in it, growing into as many
lines as `setMaxLines()` allows of what there is. Width is different:
`.width`, or `.fillX`, is heard and kept.

What it costs: a card with a field of no height in the middle of it,
unpressed by anything but a press of eight points, and written nowhere.

What is said instead: `setMaxLines()` for how far it may grow, and a card
laid out knowing that its field is one line at first and more later -- every
other word put above it or below it where it stands either way.

## What the browser's page mirrors is not quite what was drawn

A field put on the page as a `<textarea>` or an `<input>` keeps nothing of
its value in the text of the page: `innerText` answers for what is drawn in
text nodes, and a field's own value is not one of them. So a probe reading
the mirror to say what was typed must read the field's own `value`, or it
says of the field that it is empty however much was typed into it.

What it costs: a whole evening's worth of "typing does not reach the field",
read as a fault in the program when the fault was in the probe.

What is said instead: for each field, its `aria-label` and its `value`
together, and `getBoundingClientRect()` where where it is is the question.
Remember too that the element mirrored for a field is not the node drawn for
it: its node is one level up, and the element inside answers a height of its
own that is not the node's.

## What a press reaches

`hitPath` walks every child, and the child drawn last is the one a press is
given to; a node answers a press only where it says `acceptsInput()`, which
a field does, and takes the focus where it says `takesFocusOnPress()`, which
it does too. A press outside every node's bounds is given to nobody.

What it costs: a press into a card is nothing unless something was put in
the card where the press was -- the paper under everything is not enough.

## A press a node keeps is the program's to deliver

A node whose action answers by a type of its own (`Answer`) does not ask for
anything when it answers: it says it was pressed, and the scene keeps that,
as the path to the node that said so, in `skiff::scene::hostWork().pressed`.
Nothing delivers it until the program does, with `skiff::bind::press(root,
model, path)` -- which walks the tree itself, so a tree filled in imperatively
is walked as any other; a model that holds nothing is enough for the walk.

Without it nothing of the kind ever runs: every edit of a search field was
typed into the field and asked the program nothing, and the field's own text
was all there was to show for it. This is the whole difference between "the
search does nothing" and "the search asks for what was typed, every edit".

What it costs: a search that kept the whole list whatever was typed, and a
card whose field was typed into and forgotten -- read as a fault in the rows,
in the layout, and in the request, one after another, before it was read here.

What is said instead: once a frame, before what was asked for is answered and
the tree filled in again, every path the scene kept, delivered; and an action
that asks the program itself wants `using Answer = void;`, for an answer of
another type is looked for by nothing in a tree with no frames around it and
does not compile.

## What nothing measures reads as nothing wide

`nodes::Text` asks the width of its words of `skiff::paint::defaultFont()`
through `paint::Painter::measure`, and that asks the font itself. Where the
font carries no typeface -- which is what a browser has, no system there
being asked for the faces this program ships, and `load_fonts` leaving the
font empty when the directory it would ask carries none -- every measurement
comes back nothing: `SkFont::measureText` says none where there is no face.

Nothing else notices. The DOM mirror writes no `font-family`, the browser
sets the width by its own `max-content` and its own line height, and the page
reads as it should: only the scene's own numbers are a nothing for every line
in it. So every node that is as wide as the words in it (`autoSize`, both
axes, which is how a chip and the fold above an answer are made) becomes a
box of its padding alone -- a chip of 31 where its words want 44, a fold of
24 where its words want 160.

What it costs: a press asks `mirror.toScene(handle, x, y)` for the point an
element's own place in the page comes to in the scene, and the scene looks
for that point in a node whose bounds contain it. The box being narrower
than the words read, nearly every press on those words is a press into
nothing, and no node is ever asked: the fold did not open, whichever of its
words was pressed, and the leftmost pixels -- inside the padding, inside the
collapsed bounds -- were the only ones that ever did anything. Read first as
a fault in the fold, in the press, and in the hit test, one after another.

What is said instead, and where it was found out: the font is given a face
once there is one to give it, every frame, from the stand-in skiff keeps
(`SkFontMgr_New_Custom_Directory("")`), so that what measures text measures
it; and each node whose size comes of its words is told the size itself,
asked of the same measure (`words_wide` in `src/ui/message_list.cc`), rather
than left to keep a size nobody put in it. Nothing counts characters, and
where even that measure says nothing, what a letter of a fixed pitch would
come to in the size asked is what `liteAdvance` keeps.

## What the page says was pressed is what it painted last

Not the node whose bounds are smallest, and not the one drawn in front: in
the page a press is asked of one element, the one the browser itself would
have given it to, and that is the last element in the tree that holds the
point -- later in the tree is painted later, and later is on top. From that
element the walk goes *up*, to its parents, and nowhere else: a node beside
it, however much nearer it is to the point, is never asked.

What it costs: one node kept to hold a press, given `fill` and so the whole
breadth of its parent, is painted after every press to its left and over
them -- so the four presses in the bar over the messages each held the whole
bar, and every press anywhere in the bar went to the last of them (the one
hidden in a window with room for three). Nothing in the bar answered a press
anywhere: what every model is told, this conversation taken into one of its
own, given away. Behind three dots, where the room is too narrow and the
rows say their own size, the same three things did answer -- which is how
this was found, and how the difference between them was said.

What is said instead: a node made only to hold a press is given the size of
what it presses and no more, in its own place, the way the rows behind the
three dots already were. Nothing here asks a node to be transparent to
presses, for no such thing was found in this library.

Said once more, because knowing the rule and still getting it wrong are two
different things: a plate taking the whole room to put away what three dots
opened took nothing at all where it was first put -- beside the plate the
drawer already keeps, painted before the list, the messages and the bar, and
so *under* every one of them. The rule says what is painted last takes the
press; what it does not say is what order a window paints its own children
in, and that order is read where it is written (`app_window::forEachChild`,
`src/ui/window.cc`): paper, messages, the drawer's shade, drawer, list, bar,
the card's own away, card, settings, design, prompt. A plate meant to take
presses from everything below it goes as low in that list as it can while
staying above all of it -- in the card's case, between the bar and the card,
where the card and its rows are the only things still painted after it.

## Nothing else that has surprised this program yet
