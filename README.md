# progressive-chat

A client for talking to a model: the conversations of one account, the
messages in one of them, and the appearance of both. It is a **new front end
for the Agora look**, written from nothing on the stack
[mux](https://github.com/j4niwzis/mux) uses -- C++26 modules, clang, CMake,
Ninja, SDL3 and Skia through skiff -- so that it builds for the desktop, for
the web and for Android from one set of files.

Started **3 November 2026, 21:07 UTC** -- the repository's first commit.

The back end is not here yet, and it is being written apart from this tree, in
C++: what the screens show alongside it is a sample, kept in
`src/app/sample.cc`, and every change the screens ask for is answered in
memory. What a **model** is asked, though, is asked for real: on the page it
is carried by the browser's own fetch to the server that served it, answered
a piece at a time, and written into the room as it comes
(`docs/PROTOCOL.md`). A desk and a phone do not carry anything yet, and every
build says so rather than pretending otherwise.

## Why it is called Progressive Chat

Because it is meant to be seen improving. **Progressive**: each day this is a
program it is a better one, and the progression is meant to be visible to
everybody who looks -- in what it draws, in what it answers, and in what
stands said here. Development is **twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and
sixty-five days a year**, and this section of the README accumulates the
record of that: one paragraph for every day of it, added at 21:00 UTC.

Roughly: the main concepts are expected to take **about a year**. The hope is
that it is already amazing in **half** of that -- somewhere in, or a little
before, **summer**. Until then what is in this repository is **not yet a
product**: it is a test bench. Everything in it may be rewritten, and what it
draws today is here so that the next thing has something to be drawn over.

## Why this project exists

It did not begin as this. What was wanted first was a modern client for
talking to **people**, written in C++ and built for every platform from one
set of files. That was begun, and then it was left alone: what was needed, it
turned out, was not another place to talk to people, but a client to talk to
a **model** -- an agentic one, meant to be used on a phone, so small and
friendly enough to be opened there. Work on the chat client stopped.

Months later, looking for what may have been written since, there was mux:
[found in a conversation with a model](docs/how-mux-was-found.md) that had the
web to search, and kept for what it is made of rather than for what it is --
C++26 modules, clang, Skia through skiff, one program built for a window, for
a page and for a phone. Its stack is the stack here; it is what made starting
again worth it.

So what this repository is, now, is that client in its beginning: the look of
[Agora](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/agora) drawn again on it, and no back
end yet. It is **not** designed for people to talk to each other in.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| GNU/Linux desktop | ✅ works | SDL3 + Skia, Wayland/X11 |
| Android | ✅ works | NativeActivity, forked SDL3 |
| Web (WASM/Emscripten) | ✅ works | skiff.web backend |
| Windows | 🚫 not yet | no build target yet |
| iPhone (iOS simulator) | 🧪 testing | Linux build, macOS run, SDL3 + `import std`; device not yet |
| Samsung One UI | ❌ broken | Android works but One UI shell breaks layout/input |

## Where it stands

Said again every day this has been a program, newest first: what it was on
that day, not what it is meant to be one day.

This section is that accumulating: one paragraph for every twenty-four hours
of this program's development, left where it was put. Nothing written here is
rewritten to say something truer later -- what was true of it on a day stands
said of that day.

It (this readme section's workdays summaries) is written by hand. Nothing
writes here that is not that hand, and no paragraph of it is written by a
model, an agent or a script on its own.

### 2026-11-07

The last 24h gave only a thousand of new code lines. But I fixed many things
in the UI, and I am currently working on bringing better Material Design 3
in C++ to this project.

### 2026-11-06

Source code volume grew ~3× versus day one; incremental merge of the client
backend (Agora C++ Core) began; UI debugging is in full swing.

### 2026-11-05

The amount of source code more than doubled. The build system works and the
app runs. A (test) UI skeleton is almost there.

### 2026-11-04

Thousands of lines of code were written in 24 hours. The build is almost
fully debugged across desktop, web, and Android. We are near a runnable
app.

## What it is made of

```
src/core.cc              the model: ids, accounts, conversations, messages
src/config.cc            what is kept on disk: the looks, the account
src/theme*.cc            eight preset palettes, in Material's own terms
src/logic/*.cc           what the screens read out of the model
src/app/*.cc             the program, the screens, and today's sample
src/provider.cc          what one conversation asks of a model, and the body
src/provider/stream.cc   one answer arriving a frame at a time
src/provider/run.cc      one answer whole: why it is over, the message it leaves
src/provider/loop.cc     one question asked again with what its tools answered
src/tools.cc             what this program answers itself, and nothing else
src/platform/carry.cc    what hands a body over, per platform: a page's fetch
src/ui.cc, src/ui/*.cc   the window: every screen, drawn with skiff
```

Three targets, one program:

| target  | how it is built                         | what it is                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| desktop | `cmake` + Ninja, clang 23, SDL3         | a window of its own: x86_64 and arm64  |
| web     | the same cmake through Emscripten       | a page served by GitHub Pages          |
| android | the same cmake through a self-built NDK | an APK                                 |

The page is built and published by `web.yml`, and is served at
<https://progressive-chat.github.io/progressive-chat/>.

A desktop build is carried home with what only its own machine had: clang
23's own C++ library, `libc++.so.1` and `libc++abi.so.1`, put beside the
program and found there by its `$ORIGIN`, because no distribution keeps them
but the one it was built on and a machine without them says
`libc++.so.1: cannot open shared object file` before the program says a
word. Run it from the directory it came in.

Everything else is indexed at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md): the docs, the
two rules the tree is built by, one change from nothing to done, and the
words this tree says things in.

## What is known broken, and where to look first

Short: nothing is known broken on the page any more, and the phone is where
every question is. All of this has been seen, either on the deployed build
driven by hand in a browser, or in `adb logcat` from the APK -- none of it is
guessed at.

**The page asks, is answered, and says it.** Seen whole, end to end: one
`POST` to `/v1/chat/completions`, a stream answered back, the answer written
into the room as it arrives, and what it thought and what it cost written
under it (`Thought for 51 ms · 0 tool calls`, `haiku-4 31% of its window`).
Two things were wrong until today, and neither was the transport: an asking
was never told it was being carried, so every byte that arrived was dropped
by the one line that decides whether a byte is taken; and the asking itself
is a `provider::run`, which is what `test/provider_run_test.cc` feeds the
same three frames to and reads back.

**The phone starts slowly and answers nothing.** An APK is built by
`android.yml` for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`. It draws, then:

* it takes **about twenty seconds** before anything is drawn. Nothing in the
  tree explains that yet: the shared object is 13 MB, the fonts are baked
  into the binary, and there is no network to wait for;
* it **answers no press**, and Android says it is not responding.

Two answers have been ruled out since, by reading mux rather than by
guessing -- mux draws on the same phone without either of them:

* what the GPU compiled is **kept between runs** since `a0f90c8ddf0d`. Skia
  was compiling every program it needed at every start, because nothing told
  the window where to keep them; mux tells it, and now so does the window
  (`src/platform/kept.cc`). A phone is slow at compiling them, and until that
  is read off the machine it is the best candidate there is;
* what the window itself says is **heard** since `a0f90c8ddf0d`. Both SDL and
  skiff print to stderr -- among the rest the one line saying whether it is
  drawn through OpenGL or in software -- and Android throws stderr away; mux
  pipes it into logcat, and so does this now. Every question above could have
  been answered from that line, and none of them could be before it.

So: `adb logcat -d -s progressive-chat`, started twice -- the first run fills
what is kept, and the second is the one that says anything.

Where to look, when something else is wrong: everything above the transport
is covered by tests (`test/provider_run_test.cc`, the tools and the loop), so
the remaining questions are either in `src/platform/carry.cc`, which is what
hands a body over per platform, or in what a host does with a frame.

## To build it

What has to be on the machine is what mux asks for: **clang 23** with its
libc++ (there is no `import std` without one), **CMake 4.3.4 or newer**,
**Ninja**, and **gn** for Skia. `.github/actions/desktop-setup` is what the
check builds itself with, and says each of them.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"
cmake --build build --target progressive-chat
```

The web and the APK cross-compile from the same cmake: `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
of Emscripten's own for the page, and of a clang-23 NDK made from
`minimal-android-ndk.cpp` for Android (which `.github/workflows/android.yml`
does). The APK is the artifact that build publishes: `cmake/android-apk.cmake`
links the manifest of `android/AndroidManifest.xml` against the platform's own
resource package, and has the activity's classes written out by a script of the
SDL fork's -- no Java is compiled here, that script emits a dex itself --
`tools/android_apk.py` puts those two and every library they load with into an
archive, which `zipalign` lines up and `apksigner` signs. One key of this
build's own is made for it, so that what an Android refuses -- an APK no key
was put to -- is not what comes out. There is one installable per ABI, and
each named with the commit it was built from: 64-bit ARM, and the 32-bit ARM
a great many phones still are. They are the `progressive-chat-android-*` artifact of the newest android run:

<https://github.com/progressive-chat/progressive-chat/actions/workflows/android.yml>

The page is four files of its own beside the linked client: `web/index.html`,
the element skiff writes the window into, `web/bootstrap.js`, which isolates
the page and loads the client, and `web/worker.js`, the service worker that
answers the isolation headers -- the client is linked with threads, and threads
are not a page's to have without them, which a host that only serves files
cannot say. `tools/package_web.py` puts the four and the client together into
one directory, named by what the client is made of so that a page left open
does not keep one that has been replaced.

## License

Two licenses, said file by file in every one's first line:

- **`AGPL-3.0-only`** -- the infrastructure of this repository: the model, the
  settings, the palettes, the program, the build and its scripts (`LICENSE`).
- **`GPL-3.0-only`** -- the files that draw the interface as Agora draws it
  (`LICENSE-GPL-3.0`), which follow Agora's own terms.

The whole is therefore **GPL v3**, and only GPL v3: nothing here may be used
under any later version of either, and nothing here is dual-licensed.

The icon the app carries (`android/icon-source.png`, cut to every density and
both shapes by `tools/make_icons.py`) is progressive-chat's own: the picture
`progressive-chat/progressive-android` ships. The one the page carries with it
(`web/icon.svg`) is not it yet.

The one thing here that is neither is `fonts/`: Open Sans, regular and
semibold, embedded in the binary as every piece of text in the window is
drawn with them, and licensed to anyone under the SIL Open Font License 1.1
(`fonts/OFL`), which is compatible with both.

## Thanks

The stack is [mux](https://github.com/j4niwzis/mux)'s, and the way this build
is written -- the modules, their partitions, cmake-everywhere, one `std` in
the whole build -- is learned from it. The interface is drawn from
[Agora](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/agora)'s.
